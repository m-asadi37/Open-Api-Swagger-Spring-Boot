This project demonstrates the use of OpenAPI (Swagger) in a Spring Boot application. With the help of Swagger, you can easily visualize and test your REST APIs directly from a browser.

- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Automatically generates API documentation for all endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher installed on your machine.
- **Maven** for dependency management and building the project.

### Accessing H2 Console

Once the project is running, open your browser and go to:


http://localhost:83/h2-console

use this information to login:

- **JDBC URL:** jdbc:h2:mem:testDB
- **User Name:** masd
- **Password:** [empty]
	

### Accessing Swagger UI

Once the project is running, open your browser and go to:


http://localhost:83/swagger-ui/index.html


Here, you will be able to view and interact with the APIs.
